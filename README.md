# BSC Agent

## üéØ Executive Summary

The **BSC Agent** is a pioneering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI system designed to revolutionize student support services at Brigham Young University-Idaho. As the university's inaugural AI project, this system addresses critical challenges in support ticket volume and response quality while maintaining BYU-Idaho's values of Christ-like service and academic excellence.

**Current Status**: üöß **Pilot Phase** - Proof of concept with stakeholder validation in progress

## üìã Problem Statement

The BYU-Idaho Support Center (BSC) faces significant operational challenges:

- **Low email satisfaction scores** due to delayed response times
- **High operational costs** from managing 25+ part-time positions
- **Inconsistent information delivery** during peak support periods
- **Training overhead** and scheduling complexities for student workers

## üìã Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The BYU‚ÄëIdaho Support Center (BSC) currently contends with an overflowing email inbox‚Äîfar more messages arrive each day than its team of 25 part‚Äëtime student agents can feasibly address. This backlog leads to delayed responses and, as recent CSAT surveys confirm, diminished satisfaction characterized by long wait times and inconsistent answers. The manual effort spent triaging and drafting repetitive replies also diverts valuable staff hours away from higher‚Äëvalue engagements such as real‚Äëtime phone or chat support.

The BYU-Idaho Support Center (BSC) faces significant operational challenges:

- **Low email satisfaction scores** due to delayed response times
- **High operational costs** from managing 25+ part-time positions (estimated > $100,000/year)
- **Inconsistent information delivery** during peak support periods
- **Training overhead** and scheduling complexities for student workers
- **Variable service quality** impacting student experience

### Solution

An intelligent AI agent that:

1. **Automatically processes** incoming student support emails
2. **Searches knowledge base** using semantic search upon the existing BSC knowledge base (from Genesys Cloud, vectorized with OpenAI's embedding model, stored in Pinecone)
3. **Generates contextual responses** grounded in official BYU-Idaho policies
4. **Maintains human oversight** through approval workflows
5. **Ensures compliance** with FERPA and institutional values
