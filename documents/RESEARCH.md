## AI Prompting Best Practices and Frameworks (2024)

### 1. Best Practices for Prompting AI Agents
- **Clarity & Specificity:** Use concise, unambiguous language. Always define the task, audience, format, and any key constraints, especially for student support or policy-aligned queries.
- **Model Selection:** Use the most capable model versions (e.g., GPT-4.1 for the BSC Agent) for improved understanding and responses.
- **Structured Instructions:** For complex tasks, use numbered or bulleted steps to guide the model.
- **Role & Persona Assignment:** Assign a clear role (e.g., “You are a BYU-Idaho student support agent”) to control tone and style and ensure responses align with institutional values.
- **Context & Examples:** Provide necessary background (e.g., BYU-Idaho policies, FERPA requirements) and sample inputs/outputs for clarity.
- **Iteration & Refinement:** Test prompts, review outputs, and iteratively refine until the desired behavior is achieved.
- **Verification:** Request the agent to self-verify or check its answers for policy compliance, consistency, and correctness.

### 2. Prompting Frameworks
- **Zero-Shot:** Only task definition; relies on model’s pre-trained knowledge.
- **Few-Shot:** Include a handful of relevant examples illustrating expected format/quality (e.g., BSC Agent sample support tickets).
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Instruct the model to “think step-by-step,” revealing intermediate reasoning, which is critical for FERPA and institutional compliance.
- **Few-Shot CoT:** Combine examples with stepwise solutions for guided reasoning.
- **Role Prompting:** Explicitly define the agent’s institutional role to control voice and expertise.
- **Output Formatting:** Specify the desired response structure (e.g., Markdown, tables, JSON) for auditability and review.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Use frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, Microsoft Autogen, Agno, Langflow) to define roles, handoffs, and tool integrations among agents (e.g., research, compliance check, response generation for BSC Agent).

### 3. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations
- **Ambiguity:** Leads to vague or off-target outputs. Avoid by providing specific instructions, context, and examples.
- **Overly Long Prompts:** Can overwhelm or confuse the model. Keep prompts focused; offload details to linked documents where possible.
- **Prompt Injection:** Malicious or accidental inclusion of unwanted instructions. Mitigate with input sanitization, delimiters, and explicit “ignore earlier instructions” clauses.
- **Overfitting to Examples:** Few-shot examples too narrow can limit model creativity. Balance specificity and generality.
- **Ignoring Model Limits:** Do not ask for out-of-scope tasks. Understand model capabilities and limitations.
- **Inadequate Testing:** Always review outputs and iterate, flagging inconsistencies and refining prompts.

### 4. Multi-Agent Best Practices
- **Agent Specialization:** Assign distinct roles/tasks to each agent (e.g., Researcher, Analyst, Validator in BSC Agent workflows).
- **Clear Handoff Protocols:** Define how outputs from one agent become inputs to another, ensuring compliance and auditability.
- **Tool Integration:** Equip agents with relevant APIs or modules (e.g., Pinecone for semantic search, Azure PostgreSQL for data, Label Studio for evaluation).
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track agent outputs and iterate on prompt templates or agent topologies for better coordination.
- **Frameworks:** KaibanJS (Hugging Face), LangGraph, CrewAI, Microsoft Autogen, Agno, OpenAI Swarm for orchestrating multi-agent workflows.

### 6. Next Steps for BSC Agent
- Experiment with tailored prompts based on BSC Agent use cases (student support, policy Q&A).
- Incorporate these best practices into prompt design for n8n, OpenAI, and any multi-agent orchestration.
- Iterate and document empirical performance in production/pilot workflows.
