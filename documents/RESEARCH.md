# Research Summary: How to Prompt AI Agents

## 1. Best Practices
- **Clarity & Specificity:** Use concise, unambiguous language; define the task, audience, format, and constraints.
- **Latest Models:** Leverage the most capable model versions for improved understanding and responses.
- **Structured Instructions:** Use numbered or bulleted steps for complex tasks.
- **Role & Persona:** Assign a clear role (e.g., “You are an expert developer”) to set tone and style.
- **Context & Examples:** Provide necessary background and sample inputs/outputs.
- **Iteration & Refinement:** Test prompts, review outputs, and iteratively refine until desired behavior emerges.
- **Verification:** Ask the agent to self-verify or check its answers for consistency and correctness.

## 2. Prompting Frameworks
- **Zero-Shot:** Task definition only; relies on model’s pre-trained knowledge.
- **Few-Shot:** Include a handful of examples in the prompt to illustrate the expected format/quality.
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Instruct the model to “think step-by-step,” revealing its intermediate reasoning.
- **Few-Shot CoT:** Combine examples with step-by-step solutions to guide reasoning.
- **Role Prompting:** Explicitly define an agent’s role or persona to control voice and expertise.
- **Output Formatting:** Specify desired response structure (e.g., JSON schema, tables).
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Use specialized frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, Microsoft Autogen, Agno, Langflow) to define roles, handoffs, and tool integrations among multiple agents.

## 3. Common Pitfalls & Mitigations
- **Ambiguity:** Leads to vague or off-target outputs. Avoid by providing specific instructions, context, and examples.
- **Overly Long Prompts:** Can overwhelm or confuse. Keep prompts focused; offload details to external documents if needed.
- **Prompt Injection:** Malicious or accidental inclusion of unwanted instructions. Mitigate with input sanitization, instruction shielding (delimiters), and explicit “ignore earlier instructions” clauses.
- **Overfitting to Examples:** Few-shot examples too narrow can limit creativity. Balance specificity with generality.
- **Ignoring Model Limits:** Asking for out-of-scope tasks. Understand model capabilities and provide realistic tasks.
- **Inadequate Testing:** Skip iterative loops and error-checking. Always review outputs, flag inconsistencies, and refine prompts.

## 4. Multi-Agent Best Practices
- **Agent Specialization:** Assign distinct roles/tasks for each agent (e.g., Researcher, Analyst, Validator).
- **Clear Handoff Protocols:** Define how outputs from one agent become inputs to another.
- **Tool Integration:** Equip agents with relevant APIs or modules (web search, code execution, databases).
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track agent outputs and iterate prompt templates or topologies for better coordination.
- **Frameworks:** KaibanJS (Hugging Face), LangGraph, CrewAI, Microsoft Autogen, Agno, OpenAI Swarm.
